Largely designed off of https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app 

This is a Client-Server implementation. On the front end this uses React which features React Hooks, the JS library "Styled Components", and modern ES6 async/await methods. On the backend we have a Node server with the Express framework which interacts with Spotify's REST API and OAuth 2.0.
